# My first year of Advent of Code
Heard about AoC in late November, checked it out, and thought it would be good practice and be able to teach me a bit.
First few puzzles were quite easy and mostly learning about parsing input from a file properly. At that point, I
committed myself to completing the puzzles every day, as it would only be a small thing but would keep me active. Oh
how wrong I was! But I'm proud to say I got every puzzle completed before midnight, ACST. In future years, I definitely
won't commit myself to completing the puzzles on the same day, but it was fun while I had the time. I may go back and
re-do some puzzles which I used inefficient solutions for.
