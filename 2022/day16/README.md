# Part 2
Part 2 takes *forever* to complete. It never actually completed on my machine. I just got
bored of waiting and input the current maximum and it worked. I tried optimising it with 
a hash map in a previous commit but it was hungrier than a protogen eating up all my RAM.
Excited to look at other solutions.
